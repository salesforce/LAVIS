## Introduction
LAVIS is a Python deep learning library for LAnguage-and-VISion intelligence research and applications. This library aims to provide engineers and researchers with a one-stop solution to rapidly develop models for their specific multimodal scenarios, and benchmark them across standard and customized datasets.
It features a unified interface design to access
- **10+** tasks
(retrieval, captioning, visual question answering, multimodal classification etc.);
- **20+** datasets (COCO, Flickr, Nocaps, Conceptual
Commons, SBU, etc.);
- **30+** pretrained weights of state-of-the-art foundation language-vision models and their task-specific adaptations, including [ALBEF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07651.pdf),
[BLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086.pdf), [ALPRO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09583.pdf), [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf).

Key features of LAVIS include:

- **Unified and Modular Interface**: facilitating to easily leverage and repurpose existing modules (datasets, models, preprocessors), also to add new modules.

- **Easy Off-the-shelf Inference and Feature Extraction**: readily available pre-trained models let you take advantage of state-of-the-art multimodal understanding and generation capabilities on your own data.

- **Reproducible Model Zoo and Training Recipes**: easily replicate and extend state-of-the-art models on existing and new tasks.

- **Dataset Zoo and Automatic Downloading Tools**: it can be a hassle to prepare the many language-vision datasets. LAVIS provides automatic downloading scripts to help prepare a large variety of datasets and their annotations.

# gpt_dialogue                   base
```

Letâ€™s see how to use models in LAVIS to perform inference on example data. We first load a sample image from local.

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
# setup device to use
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
# load sample image
raw_image = Image.open("docs/_static/merlion.png").convert("RGB")
```

This example image shows [Merlion park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlion) ([source](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/what-exactly-is-singapores-merlion-anyway/)), a landmark in Singapore.


### Image Captioning
In this example, we use the BLIP model to generate a caption for the image. To make inference even easier, we also associate each
pre-trained model with its preprocessors (transforms), accessed via ``load_model_and_preprocess()``.

```python
import torch
from lavis.models import load_model_and_preprocess
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
# loads BLIP caption base model, with finetuned checkpoints on MSCOCO captioning dataset.
# this also loads the associated image processors
model, vis_processors, _ = load_model_and_preprocess(name="blip_caption", model_type="base_coco", is_eval=True, device=device)
# preprocess the image
# vis_processors stores image transforms for "train" and "eval" (validation / testing / inference)
image = vis_processors["eval"](raw_image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
# generate caption
model.generate({"image": image})
# ['a large fountain spewing water into the air']
```

### Visual question answering (VQA)
BLIP model is able to answer free-form questions about images in natural language.
To access the VQA model, simply replace the ``name`` and ``model_type`` arguments
passed to ``load_model_and_preprocess()``.

```python
from lavis.models import load_model_and_preprocess
model, vis_processors, txt_processors = load_model_and_preprocess(name="blip_vqa", model_type="vqav2", is_eval=True, device=device)
# ask a random question.
question = "Which city is this photo taken?"
image = vis_processors["eval"](raw_image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
question = txt_processors["eval"](question)
model.predict_answers(samples={"image": image, "text_input": question}, inference_method="generate")
# ['singapore']
```

### Unified Feature Extraction Interface

LAVIS provides a unified interface to extract features from each architecture. 
To extract features, we load the feature extractor variants of each model.
The multimodal feature can be used for multimodal classification.
The low-dimensional unimodal features can be used to compute cross-modal similarity.


```python
from lavis.models import load_model_and_preprocess
model, vis_processors, txt_processors = load_model_and_preprocess(name="blip_feature_extractor", model_type="base", is_eval=True, device=device)
caption = "a large fountain spewing water into the air"
image = vis_processors["eval"](raw_image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
text_input = txt_processors["eval"](caption)
sample = {"image": image, "text_input": [text_input]}

features_multimodal = model.extract_features(sample)
print(features_multimodal.multimodal_embeds.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 12, 768]), use features_multimodal[:,0,:] for multimodal classification tasks

features_image = model.extract_features(sample, mode="image")
features_text = model.extract_features(sample, mode="text")
print(features_image.image_embeds.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 197, 768])
print(features_text.text_embeds.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 12, 768])

# low-dimensional projected features
print(features_image.image_embeds_proj.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 197, 256])
print(features_text.text_embeds_proj.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 12, 256])
similarity = features_image.image_embeds_proj[:,0,:] @ features_text.text_embeds_proj[:,0,:].t()
print(similarity)
# tensor([[0.2622]])
```

### Load Datasets
LAVIS inherently supports a wide variety of common language-vision datasets by providing [automatic download tools](https://opensource.salesforce.com/LAVIS//latest/benchmark) to help download and organize these datasets. After downloading, to load the datasets, use the following code:

```python
from lavis.datasets.builders import dataset_zoo
dataset_names = dataset_zoo.get_names()
print(dataset_names)
# ['aok_vqa', 'coco_caption', 'coco_retrieval', 'coco_vqa', 'conceptual_caption_12m',
#  'conceptual_caption_3m', 'didemo_retrieval', 'flickr30k', 'imagenet', 'laion2B_multi',
#  'msrvtt_caption', 'msrvtt_qa', 'msrvtt_retrieval', 'msvd_caption', 'msvd_qa', 'nlvr',
#  'nocaps', 'ok_vqa', 'sbu_caption', 'snli_ve', 'vatex_caption', 'vg_caption', 'vg_vqa']
```
After downloading the images, we can use ``load_dataset()`` to obtain the dataset.
```python
from lavis.datasets.builders import load_dataset
coco_dataset = load_dataset("coco_caption")
print(coco_dataset.keys())
# dict_keys(['train', 'val', 'test'])
print(len(coco_dataset["train"]))
# 566747
print(coco_dataset["train"][0])
# {'image': <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x480>,
#  'text_input': 'A woman wearing a net on her head cutting a cake. ',
#  'image_id': 0}
```

If you already host a local copy of the dataset, you can pass in the ``vis_path`` argument to change the default location to load images.

```python
coco_dataset = load_dataset("coco_caption", vis_path=YOUR_LOCAL_PATH)
```

- **GUI Demo**: to run the demo locally, run ```bash run_scripts/run_demo.sh``` and then follow the instruction on the prompts to view in browser. A web demo is coming soon.


## Documentations
For more details and advanced usages, please refer to
[documentation](https://opensource.salesforce.com/LAVIS//latest/index.html#).

## Ethical and Responsible Use
We note that models in LAVIS provide no guarantees on their multimodal abilities; incorrect or biased predictions may be observed. In particular, the datasets and pretrained models utilized in LAVIS may contain socioeconomic biases which could result in misclassification and other unwanted behaviors such as offensive or inappropriate speech. We strongly recommend that users review the pre-trained models and overall system in LAVIS before practical adoption. We plan to improve the library by investigating and mitigating these potential biases and
inappropriate behaviors in the future.
