## BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models
This is the official implementation of BLIP-2 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597), a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that easily harvests development of pretrained vision models and large language models (LLMs) for vision-language pretraining. BLIP-2 beats Flamingo on zero-shot VQAv2 (**65.0** vs **56.3**), establishing new state-of-the-art on zero-shot captioning (on NoCaps **121.6** CIDEr score vs previous best **113.2**). Equipped with powerful LLMs (e.g. OPT, FlanT5), BLIP-2 also unlocks the new **zero-shot instructed vision-to-language generation** capabilities for various interesting applications!

# blip2                          pretrain, coco
```

### Inference Example
Letâ€™s see how to use BLIP-2 models to perform zero-shot instructed image-to-text generation. We first load a sample image from local.
```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
# setup device to use
device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
# load sample image
raw_image = Image.open("../docs/_static/merlion.png").convert("RGB")
display(raw_image.resize((596, 437)))
```

Then we load a pre-trained BLIP-2 model with its preprocessors (transforms).
```python
import torch
from lavis.models import load_model_and_preprocess
# loads BLIP-2 pre-trained model
model, vis_processors, _ = load_model_and_preprocess(name="blip2_t5", model_type="pretrain_flant5xxl", is_eval=True, device=device)
# prepare the image
image = vis_processors["eval"](raw_image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
```

Given the image and a text prompt, ask the model to generate the response.
```python
model.generate({"image": image, "prompt": "Question: which city is this? Answer:"})
# 'singapore'
```

Ask the model to explain its answer.
```python
model.generate({
    "image": image,
    "prompt": "Question: which city is this? Answer: singapore. Question: why?"})
# 'it has a statue of a merlion'    
```


Ask a follow-up question.
```python
# prepare context prompt
context = [
    ("which city is this?", "singapore"),
    ("why?", "it has a statue of a merlion"),
]
question = "where is the name merlion coming from?"
template = "Question: {} Answer: {}."
prompt = " ".join([template.format(context[i][0], context[i][1]) for i in range(len(context))]) + " Question: " + question + " Answer:"
print(prompt)
# generate model's response
model.generate({"image": image,"prompt": prompt})
# 'merlion is a portmanteau of mermaid and lion'
```
